title: HigherEd Adaptive Directory
layout: default

These are sites that donâ€™t quite [fit the definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) of responsive, but deserve mentioning. Typically they only lack the fluid grid.

** I've combined the Adaptive/Hybrid sites [with the Responsive sites](/highered-rwd-directory/) and labeled them accordingly. **
