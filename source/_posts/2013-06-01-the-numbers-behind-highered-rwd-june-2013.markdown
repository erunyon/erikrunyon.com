title: "The Numbers Behind HigherEd RWD - June 2013"

Back in January [I posted numbers](/2013/01/the-numbers-behind-highered-rwd/) gathered from the [HigherEd RWD Directory](/highered-rwd-directory/). The size of the list has more than doubled since then. The bad news? Almost every number has increased (that's a bad thing). Additional stats since last report includes image count, size and percentage of page weight.

## HigherEd RWD Sites: 112

### Desktop

I tested with a browser width of ~1200px. Load time is based on a combination of tests from SW Michigan and Northern Indiana. Distance to hosts could definitely be a factor.

* **Load Time:** 3.419 seconds
* **Requests:** 59.1
* **Size:** 1.6 MB
* **Images** 33.6
* **Image Size** 1.3 MB
* **Image % of total page weight** 76%
* **CSS Files:** 6.6
* **CSS Size:** 99.4 KB
* **JS Files:** 11.7
* **JS Size:** 191.6 KB

### Small Screen

These numbers were gathered using a desktop browser at a narrow width (~320px) and an iPhone 5 UA string to attempt a simulation of a mobile device. For this reason, "load time" should be taken with an extremely large grain of salt.

* **Load time:** 3.041 seconds
* **Requests:** 55.1
* **Size:** 1.5 MB
* **Images** 30.38
* **Image Size** 1.1 MB
* **Image % of total page weight** 73%
* **CSS Files:** 6.5
* **CSS Size:** 99.6 kb
* **JS Files:** 11.8
* **JS Size:** 216.8 KB

### Mobile Sites

Out of curiosity, I tried to find dedicated "mobile" sites for each of the 112 RWD sites in the directory, of which I found 47 (doubled since last report), to compare numbers. The focus here was on size, not load time.

* **Load Time:** 1.62 seconds
* **Size:** 180.4 kb
