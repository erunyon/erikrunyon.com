Last weekend my wife and I went away for a four day get-away at a resort hotel. Initially I had the idea I would take my laptop along just in case the hotel had wi-fi. After a bit of consideration, I decided against it. After all, it’s a vacation, right?<!-- more -->

After we arrived, I noticed in the hotel information that there was a business center with high-speed internet and public computers. So naturally, I checked to make sure I knew where it was during our tour on the first day. You know, just in case.

However, after a couple of days, I began to realize I CAN live without this thing called the internet. At least for four days. This may not seem like a big deal to some of you, but those four days were by far the longest I’ve gone “unplugged” in the past, oh, decade I think. Sad but true.

But at least now that I know it can be done, I won’t have to do it again. My poor inter-web, I will never leave you alone for so long again.
