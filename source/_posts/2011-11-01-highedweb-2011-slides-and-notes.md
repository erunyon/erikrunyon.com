Last week I attended [HighEdWeb][1] which took place in Austin, TX. This was my first trip to this conference, and perhaps feeling a little over-ambitious, I co-presented a talk with programmer extraordinaire [Jeremy Friesen][2] titled “Feeding the Beast”, which was about encouraging API use around [Notre Dame][3]. I also took part in the poster presentation portion of the conference and presented on how we (Marketing and Communications) use a base theme to build all our sites which gives us a jump-start on accessibility and mobile on each design.

The code for Jeremy’s and my talk and the visuals for my poster presentation [are up on my GitHub account][4] Also included are Jeremy’s and my notes for the talks we attended. Slides for the [API presentation are on Speaker Deck][5].
