About a year and a half ago I started researching the web development offerings at Notre Dame and found that there wasn't a basic web development course. Yes, there were courses covering web design, javascript, mobile application development, and others, but nothing that covered the basics of getting into semantic HTML, CSS, and javascript. Taking a bit of a chance, I reached out to several departments to see if any of them would be interested in a new course. I received a fairly quick response from the [Computer Applications Program](http://capp.nd.edu/) and we quickly put together a plan to offer a course titled "Introduction to Web Development", with a class description of "The goal of this course is to provide working experience with the full range of front-end technology needed to produce a modern website. The course will cover Planning, Discovery, Information Architecture, Wireframing, Semantic HTML Markup, CSS Layout and javascript. Emphasis will be placed on building sites that can be viewed on any device using Progressive Enhancement and Responsive Web Design/Development". We ran the course in the Fall of 2013. I was left to my own devices as to the course material, what we covered, grades, tests, quizzes, etc.
