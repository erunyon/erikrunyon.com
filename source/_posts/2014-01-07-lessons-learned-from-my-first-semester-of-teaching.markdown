About a year and a half ago I started researching the web development offerings at Notre Dame and found that there wasn't a basic web development course. Yes, there were courses covering web design, javascript, mobile application development, and others, but nothing that covered the basics of getting into semantic HTML, CSS, and javascript. Taking a bit of a chance, I reached out to several departments to see if any of them would be interested in a new course. I received a fairly quick response from the [Computer Applications Program](http://capp.nd.edu/) and we quickly put together a plan to offer a course titled "Introduction to Web Development", with a class description of "The goal of this course is to provide working experience with the full range of front-end technology needed to produce a modern website. The course will cover Planning, Discovery, Information Architecture, Wireframing, Semantic HTML Markup, CSS Layout and javascript. Emphasis will be placed on building sites that can be viewed on any device using Progressive Enhancement and Responsive Web Design/Development". We ran the course in the Fall of 2013. I was left to my own devices as to the course material, what we covered, grades, tests, quizzes, etc. Below I'll cover those resources and material, as well as what worked, what didn't, and what I'd change if I do it again.

## Basics

Time is going to be an issue. I taught the class in addition to my full-time job. I wasn't prepared for how much time it would take every week to prepare class outlines, quizzes, projects, code examples, etc. It can easily take three or more hours to prepare for a single class. And that doesn't count grading projects afterward.

Whether we realize it or not, we use A LOT of industry jargon in our field. Be careful that whenever you use an acronym or term that's new for the students, to explain it. Next time I plan on keeping a list of terms for the students to reference. Anytime one of them asks what something is, add it to the list.

## Grading

The course took place over 28 classes. Grading was based on the following:

- 16 Quizzes 30%
- 22 Projects 40%
- Final Project 30%

The quizzes were used to make sure the students completed their reading assignments. Each one consisted of 3 multiple-choice questions based on the material we were to cover, and were administered at the beginning of class with a 4-minute time limit, and were open-book. Projects were used to allow the students to practice what was covered in class in a practical way. In retrospect, I would probably drop to 20 projects, make quizzes worth 20% and projects worth 50%.

## Materials

The only required materials for the class was [Learning Web Design 4th Edition](http://amzn.to/16fVcJf) by [Jennifer Robbins](https://twitter.com/jenville). This book covers most of the basics needed for the aspiring web developer. It has enough on each topic to provide a good intro to which we could expand on in class. All other topics not covered were supplemented by articles freely available on the web.

## Tools

I allowed the students to pick their own text editor for the class, but I provided a list of recommendations. I just guessed on the Windows apps since I had no idea on those. I required all students use Chrome for testing. With Chrome's aggressive auto-updates, I could be fairly certain we'd all be on the same version. So that way if the code worked for the student, it would work for me when grading projects. Chrome also has excellent support for modern HTML/CSS as well as (arguably) the best developer tools.

All students were also required to open [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) accounts and [GitHub](https://github.com/) accounts. 

For projects, students hosted all files on their university provided "webfile" spaces or Codepen. However, after the class wrapped, I learned from some feedback that some students believed their code was being lifted by other students. I did not know until after the class ended that [GitHub offers students free private repos](https://github.com/edu). Next time I will definitely go that route.
