First blog post. Ever.

So what does one say to his non-existent readers? There will most definitely be some design changes. There will be random chatter about Macs, web development and web development using Macs. I’m sure there will also be a whole sloo of random. I hope this site will find its voice in short order, but we’ll just have to wait and see.

Thanks for dropping by.
