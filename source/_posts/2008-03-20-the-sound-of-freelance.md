…is silence.

I had the best of intentions. I wanted to give you words. Words to make you laugh. Words to make you cry. Words to excite, enlighten and inspire.

So what happened?<!-- more -->

Code. Code happened. I’m up to my eyeballs in freelance work. Many of you know first hand how busy things can get when you work full-time, and also take side jobs. There may be relief soon. My previous employer is finally beefing up his stable of monkey’s. These monkey’s will soon take over the work I’ve been handling since I left the outfit last July. This will hopefully free up some evening time so I can finally write some decent articles. I’m making a list, checking it twice, and will begin authoring soon.

Stay tuned. I plan on doing some small articles soon, as well as a book review.

Maybe.
