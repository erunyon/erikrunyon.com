This year I had the opportunity to present at [Breaking Development](http://bdconf.com/2013/san-diego/). I've attended twice previously and always come away with more ideas and inspiration than I can feasibly find time to implement.

The conference was held in the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego. Quite a different venue than the bio-domes of past BD conferences.

## My Presentation

The title was *"Before the @mq: Making the decisons that make a site responsive"*. I essentially demoed how some sites deal with images to increase performance. The first example was the [BBC's mobile site](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news) and how it loads images for individual articles. The second was [West Virginia University's](http://www.wvu.edu/) carousel. I'd like to thank [Tom Maslen](https://twitter.com/tmaslen) of the BBC and [Dave Olsen](https://twitter.com/dmolsen) of WVU for their feedback and willingness to answer questions. Lastly, I discussed how we took the inital load of [ND.edu](http://www.nd.edu/) and reduced it from over 3 MB to under 400 KB.

I'm not the greatest note-taker by any means, but below are what I have from the other presentations.

### One Design to Rule Them All

- [Sketchnotes](https://twitter.com/thinknow/status/359361637813211136/photo/1) by [Lane Halley](https://twitter.com/thinknow)
- Tablets category as "mobile" is up for interpretation
- There are smartphones with higher res than tablets
- Palm/Lap/Desktop categories
- Most active use is 3-5" phones
- We no longer know what's a touch interface
- Netflix uses "distance from screen" for design decisions

Summary:

1. Support a continuum of screens
2. Account for hi-res
3. Optimize for touch
4. Support cursor and keyboard

### Visit-Speed: Page Speed is Only the Beginning
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1747)
- `<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="">`
- It's the only way to beat latency
- Resources to pre-fetch: DNS, HTML, images, javascript, CSS (especially DNS)
- Local Storage is faster than browser cache
- Pre-fetch other resources only after current page is finished
- Make smart decisions on client side by looking at what people are using/doing
- CSS/JS are smaller than images and better candidates for pre-fetching

## Barbara Bermes
### Embracing Performance in Today's Multi-Platform Macrocosm
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1749)
- Comparing mobile to native is like comparing dept store suit to taylored
- use AMD
- Each http request costs around 200ms
- Focus on performance optimization during build

## James Williamson
### Is Flexbox the Future of Layout?
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1748)
- Flexbox allows for horizontal, vertical and baseline alignment
- Source-order independent
- Flexbox 2012 syntax is now stable
- Can use now, but need to use 2009 and 2012 syntax and vendor prefixes
- When defining a flex container, all direct children and flex items; specify row or column
- Images as a flex item resolves to zero
- Don't overuse it
- Understand flex-basis
- Flex item margins DON'T collapse (even vertically)
- [Comment by Paul Irish on Flexbox performance](http://css-tricks.com/does-flexbox-have-a-performance-problem/#comment-490956)

## Divya Manian
### Next Generation Layout on the Web
- [Slides](http://nimbu.in/bdconf/)
- Center content vertically with flexbox
- Widows/Orphans - specify word count; it's only a recommendation to the browser
- CSS Regions allow the flow of conent from one element to another
- shape-inside/shape-outside: create polygon for content

## Jason Grigsby
### Adaptive Input
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1750)
- TV interface: Larger text and fewer words
- TV interface: Should be a grid (support d-pad interaction)
- Most js libraries split their desktop and mobile js widgets
- The web never had a fixed canvas, but we adopted standard sizes anyway
- Input represents a much bigger challenge than screen size
- Web speech API works in Chrome
- moreawesomeweb.com
- geolocation is a form of input
- demos of voice input using the Web Speech API bit.ly/15bVSz5 bit.ly/1dQFaY2
- No hover state on mobile?
- Pointer events spec normalizes touch and mouse
- You're designing for user need not for a specific form factor or input

### Pitfalls & Triumphs of the Cross-Screen Experience
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1751)
- [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/cameronmoll/the-cross-screen-experience-pitfalls-and-triumphs)
- 77% of mobile searches happen at home or work (Google study)
- 31% of US adults own a tablet
- Moll's Law: The best interface is the one that's within reach
- Discrete: An experience on one screen independet of, but ideally cohesive with, experiences on other screens
- Up to 49% email themselves a lik for continuing the activity on another device
- Don't stereotype devices or their owners
- Don't fall prey to the convenience of device silos
- Use abstract terms instead of mobile/tablet/desktop silos
- Respect users' mental models, aesthetically and functionally
- Don't unforgivingly force your app on your users
- Use vertical media queries if necessary

## Eric Bidelman
### Web Components: a new way of building web apps
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1752)
- Web components allow us to create or own custom tags
- Can create full apps inside a tag
- Extend standard elements: is="mega-button"
- Encapsulate functionality
- Building blocks of web components
	- Shadow DOM
		- markup/style encapsulation
		- can inspect shadow dom by enabling it in dev tools
	- HTML Templates
		- Chunks of inert markup for later use
		- `<template/>`
		- Parsed, not rendered
		- Hidden from document
		- can contain external style sheet links
	- Custom Elements
		- named in x-foo format
		- can contain javascript with callbacks
		- "extends" on standard elements
	- HTML Imports
		- link rel "import" in head then used in html with custom tag
		- Package, distribute, share, reuse
		- Not available in any browser (polyfill availabile)
	- MDV - data binding

### Prototyping Style
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1754)
- [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/bencallahan/prototyping-style-2013-breaking-development)
- Linear process and RWD didn't play well together
- A "1 deliverable" workflow is centered on iteration
- Use tools you are comfortable with to establish teh aesthetic
- [http://froont.com/](http://froont.com/)
- If you're designing in the browser, be sure you're fluent in the medium
- Group improvisation when building
	- requires individual team members to be great, humble and empathetic
- If you can't so "no", it's not collaboration
- Create guidelines instead of rigid processes
- Invest in people over process

## Hampton Catlin
### How to Build The Right Thing
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1753)
- Quality w/o clear understanding is meaningless
- Don't just complain about problems, fix it
- Take the simplest approach you think will work
- Solutions only come from problems
- Whatever is driving you crazy, you're not the only one
- Do something cool

## Dennis Kardys

### Mobile Content(ment): Turning Disruption into Transformation
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1755)
- Business' are trying to treat web and mobile as an add-on
- Our new job is playing a "bridge". Guide people from the old to the new.
- We spend more time creating walls than bridges
- Content is a pain, but we can use it to our advantage
- Choose participation, not just presentation. Include stake-holders and users early in the process.
- Your site can't be user-centered if your content is self-centered

### Optimizing the Critical Rendering Path: hard facts and implications
- [Notes by @LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1756)
- [Slides](bit.ly/bd-crp)
- 85% of users expect mobile sites to load as fast or faster than desktop sites
- Speed is a feature
- Google wants every page to render within 1 second
- latency is the biggest bottle-neck of the network request
- 3g will be the dominant network around the world through this decade
- TCP Slow Start is a feature, not a bug
- 50% of the 1000ms budget is in network latency overhead
- Must account for TCP slow start
- Flush the header first so you can parse html incrementally
- screen cannot be rendered until dom and css are rectified
	- Rendering is blocked on CSS
	- Get CSS down the client as fast as possible
- javascript can query (and modify) the DOM
- load js as async
	- async assures the browser that you're not going to modify the DOM
- Goal: render the useful part of the page in one second, not the WHOLE page
- Inline the above the fold CSS and JS
- Defer non-critical assets
- Put all of your critical assets on the same domain
- Move critical css into document head
- use Chrome Audits tool
