A photo from [BDConf San Diego (July 2013)](https://bdconf.com/events/2013/San%20Diego/) has popped up [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zeldman/12637861493/in/pool-aeaatlanta14) and [there](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zeldman/12637727195/in/pool-aeaatlanta14) around the web. However, it quite often is lacking context around what's actually being depicted. The photo shows a responsive website printed out at the width of an iPhone. The reason it's notable is because the result is a ridiculously long website. However, this depiction of the site doesn't actually get served to mobile devices.<!--more-->

Over the past couple of years I've been presenting on the topics of "responsible" RWD, performance, RESS, and the like. Much of it has made reference to [www.nd.edu](http://www.nd.edu/) which makes use of RESS to deliver different markup to different form factors while (mostly) maintaining content parity. The main difference is that while the "desktop" version is extremely long, the "mobile" version is much smaller at approximately 2.something iPhone 5 screens tall. However, all of the content for the "desktop" version is available through primary and secondary navigation. What the prop in the image is meant to depict is how ridiculously long the mobile version of the site would be if we did NOT optimize. Unfortunately, that message is not always conveyed along with the image with the result of some internet teeth gnashing over how silly it is that such a site would ever be served to small screen devices.

My point exactly.
