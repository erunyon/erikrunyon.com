In a recent discussion on Twitter, I was asked what podcasts I listen to. Since the list wouldn't fit into a 140 character tweet, I figured I'd post the list here in case it would help others find new shows. If you have suggestions for other podcasts that a geek would enjoy, please leave a comment below.
