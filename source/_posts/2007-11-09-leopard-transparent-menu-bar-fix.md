One of the first complaints many voiced when Leopard was released was the transparent menu bar. I am well aware that there are a [couple][1] of [applications][2] out there that will fix this, but there’s also a rather simple way if you have access to an image editor.

Here’s what my menu bar looked like with the transparency:

Now all you have to do is take your desktop picture and edit it in any graphics program you choose. At the very top, select 21 pixels and fill it with white.

Here’s the result:

You could also add a gradient:

Granted, that last one is a bit subtle, but you could experiment and come up with something much nicer than I did. So there you have it. The transparent menu bar in Leopard doesn’t have to be so bad. Try your own and have fun with it. For those who are curious, here’s a full shot of my desktop.
