title: "Carousel Interaction Stats - June 2013 Update"

Carousels continue to be a hot topic. [The numbers I posted back in January](/2013/01/carousel-stats/) resulted in quite a bit of discussion. Out of curiosity, I decided to revisit the data now that I have more data to pull from. The following numbers are from January 1 through June 30, 2013. We'll be looking at the same five sites which include [ND.edu](http://www.nd.edu/) and four un-named Notre Dame sites.

## ND.edu

Feature are not randomized. New items go into position one and typically fall off the end. However, sometimes newer items are pulled out of rotation before older, and other times older items are returned to position one.

- Homepage visits: 3,755,297
- Percentage that clicked a feature: 1.07%

Percentage of total clicks for each position:

- Position 1: 89.1%
- Position 2: 3.1%
- Position 3: 2.4%
- Position 4: 2.8%
- Position 5: 2.6%

## Site 2

Site two is an aggregated news site. Features are loaded with newest story first and fall off in order of appearance. It is the only one of the examples that uses an auto-playing carousel. We typically don't create auto-playing carousels because we're not fans, and [some research shows other's don't like them much either](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/). However, the numbers for this site are quite different from the others. The most notable is that it has a much higher feature click percentage.

- Homepage visits: 43,724
- Percentage that clicked a feature: 9.409%

Percentage of total clicks for each position:

- Position 1: 54.57%
- Position 2: 17.87%
- Position 3: 10.84%
- Position 4: 8.75%
- Position 5: 7.97%
