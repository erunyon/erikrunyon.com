I've never been one for New-Years resolutions, but I do like to make myself a list of items I'd like to accomplish over the next year. This rarely, if ever, centers around the typical weight-loss/exercise resolutions as I prefer to focus my goals around learning and growing professionally.<!-- more -->

## The List

1. Learn the [CSS Grid Layout Module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/). While [support is still pretty low](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), it's going to come in handy sooner rather than later.
2. Master Flexbox. Because it's pretty darn cool, and with tools such as auto-prefixer, we can use it today.
3. Create an open-source project to analyze [Webpage Test](http://www.webpagetest.org/) data. I work with a lot of sites on a daily basis at work, and it would be really helpful to have a tool I can use to automatically pull data from WPT and get reports on how my sites are doing. Might as well make it open-source in the process.
4. Learn [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift). I've only looked at the language from a very high level, and so far I find it rather pleasant. And with Swift being open-source, there's a very good chance we'll be able to use it on the web (server-side) before too long.
