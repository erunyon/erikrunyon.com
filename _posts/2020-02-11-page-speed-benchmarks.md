A new performance visualiztion tool was just launched by [@speedcurve](https://twitter.com/speedcurve) which they describe as:

> …an interactive dashboard that lets you explore and compare web performance data for leading websites across several industries – from retail to media.

I'd love so see a higher education category in the near future.
