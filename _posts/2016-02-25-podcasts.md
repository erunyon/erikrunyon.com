It's been quite a while since [I originally listed my podcast listening lineup](/2013/09/podcasts/), and a lot has changed since then. <!-- more -->If you have suggestions for other podcasts that a geek would enjoy, please leave a comment below. If you need a recommendation for a podcast player (and you're on iOS), I would suggest giving [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) a shot. It has some great features that really speed up listening, which is very handy when you subscribe to a lot of podcasts.
