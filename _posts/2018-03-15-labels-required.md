[Maggie Wachs](https://twitter.com/maggiewachs) of [Filament Group](https://twitter.com/filamentgroup) writes about the importance of using labels from an accessibility standpoint.

> Out of the box, the `label` element is all we need to indentify fields in an accessible way. Used in combination with accessible hiding and other helper elements, like `placeholder` or icons, we can ensure that a form element's purpose is clearly communicated to all users.
