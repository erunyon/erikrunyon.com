I had the opportunity to re-present my talk (Rebuilding a university homepage to be "responsive". Twice. In less than a year.) from last fall's [HighEdWeb national conference](http://www.highedweb.org/) at this year's [Michigan regional conference](http://mi.highedweb.org/) in Flint, MI. The majority of the presentation is the same, but it includes updated data from the [RWD directory](/highered-rwd-directory/) and some interesting stats from the BCS bowl game in January.<!-- more --> The slides are embedded below.
