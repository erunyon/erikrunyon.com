## Description

Improving Web Performance in a Mobile World

Mobile usage has grown by leaps and bounds over the last decade, and not just for entertainment. Financial decisions are being made using mobile devices, and if your website is slow, it can influence how users perceive your brand.

After this session, you’ll be able to:

- Better understand why web performance matters, and not just to mobile users
- Share with co-workers real-world examples of where time equals money
- Measure your site’s performance and compare it to your competitors (with videos!)
- Influence, and improve, the performance of your company’s website for bigger sales
