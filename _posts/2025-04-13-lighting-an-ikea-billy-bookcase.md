title: Lighting an Ikea Billy Bookcase

This past December I had the opportunity to put together my first proper home office. One aspect of the office is a bookshelf to corral all my books and memorabilia that up to this point have been scattered around the house. For this project I utilized three Ikea Billy bookcases, but to make the project really shine, I added LED lighting. Let's go over the products and process I followed to set this up.

## TL;DR

- LED and wire channels = clean finish
- Cable management = worth the effort
- Splicing wires = most time-consuming
- End result = cozy, nerd-approved display

The HÖGBO doors come with inserts to hide the contents, but since the whole point here is to enjoy the display, I left those off. The reason for the doors is to keep everything inside relatively dust-free. These doors are made for the Billy cases, so they're relatively easy to install.

## Step 1: LED channel

<figure class="inline-block"><img src="/images/2025/bookshelf-channel.jpg" width="1429" height="952" loading="lazy" alt="The underside of a bookshelf with a black channel affixed to one edge">

A big priority for this project was to make the lighting look as clean as possible. So for step one I cut and installed the channel diffuser along the front lip of shelf. The diffuser channel is alumnium, so I used a hacksaw to cut to length. Luckily there was enough space between the shelf mounts and the front lip. To allow space for the wiring to run from the diffuser channel to the cable channel (see step #2), I cut a small notch.

To connect the LED strip to the wiring I used 2-pin transparent connectors. This way the LED strip was only running along the front of the shelf, and the wiring could then do a 90-degree turn to head out the back of the case. If you look close, you would be able to see the connectors at the right end of the LED strip near the wall of the shelf. But I made sure these connections were at the door end of my office, so they're less noticeable.

## Step 2: Cable channel

The cable channel is added to the underside of each shelf to hide the wiring that runs from the LED strips to the back of the shelf where the wiring is joined. For this I drilled a hole just large enough for the wiring. This is a peel-and-stick product, so installation was simply a matter of cutting the plastic channel to fit, and then sticking it to the underside of the shelf. **NOTE:** Due to how I ran the wiring through the back of the shelf, it does not allow for future adjustment to the height of the shelves. It's not an issue in my case since I was going for a symmetrical, even-height look.

## Step 3: Connecting the wires

<figure class="inline-block"><img src="/images/2025/bookshelf-channels-and-light.jpg" width="1600" height="900" loading="lazy" alt="A lit LED strip with the red/black wiring hidden by cable channel."></figure>

The LED kit I purchased came with two 5-meter (16.4 ft) LED strips. The included controller had two outputs, one for each strip. Since I'm lighting nine separate shelves and the top of the cases, this required quite a bit of wire splicing. But since all of the cables were exiting through the back of the cases, it was easy to hide the mess. Wiring was easily the most labor intensive part of the project as there was quite a bit of experimentation and testing before I found a solution that I liked and worked well.

## Step 4: Finish adding light strips

I forgot to take some intermittent shots at this juncture. I installed LED strips along the underside of each shelf for an even glow across all levels. Connecting the light strips was probably the easiest and fastest step in the process. As you can see in the image above, none of the red/black wiring is visible. All that's left is to finish attaching the top LED strip. After that comes the fun part… DECORATING!

## The finished product

My daughter was a big help in this final step. Much to my wife's delight, we gathered all of the books and trinkets and began the organizing process. We attempted to organize by theme and genre as much as possible. But given that it's a mad collection of various books, 80's toys, and general nerddom trinkets, it was at times a challenge. And I have been adding and removing items as I've found more stuff stashed away in boxes. As soon as I can find my original NES, it will joining the collection (I know it's in a box in the basement somewhere). The end result is a great backdrop for my new home office.

The lighting kit is dimmable which is great. I almost never run at full brightness. In the morning, I go with 10% brightness. Later in the day I'll bump up to 25-50%. It just depends on time of day, weather (light coming in through the windows), and general mood.

If you have a use-case for lighted shelves, I highly recommend this project. It really makes the space feel cozy. However, if you're not comfortable working with low-voltage wiring, I would recommend finding light strips that are already cut to length.
