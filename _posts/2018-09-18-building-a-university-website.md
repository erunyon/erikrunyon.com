The current version of [www.nd.edu](https://www.nd.edu/) was launched on April 1, 2012. While the site has served us well for six years, it's time for a refresh. For the past several months, [ND Strategic Content](https://twitter.com/NDStories), the [ND Web Team](https://twitter.com/ndwebteam), and many partners across campus have been working together to create something fresh and new.<!-- more -->

Over the next few weeks I'll post a series of articles discussing a variety of issues ranging from technical requirements, performance, layout, etc, as well as periodic updates on progress and challenges.

## Building in the open

Do you like broken websites? Have we got a treat for you! We've made the dev server open to the public. At any point between now and when we're finished (aiming for mid-October 2018), you can see our progress at [new.nd.edu](https://new.nd.edu/).

You should expect to see completely broken layouts as we build the site design and style content. I plan on submitting the site at the end of each day to [the Internet Archive](http://archive.org/) for posterity (an early version can be [viewed on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180926195150/https://new.nd.edu/)). I will also link to those archives if/when I'm commenting on a specific stage of the build.

If you have any questions or comments about the **process**, feel free to [contact me via my contact form](https://erikrunyon.com/contact/) or [@erunyon on Twitter](https://twitter.com/erunyon). If you find something broken, check it again later üòÅ.
