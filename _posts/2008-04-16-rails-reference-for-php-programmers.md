Back when I first started with Rails, I noticed there were a lot of times I just needed to know the Ruby/Rails equivalent of some PHP function. It started me thinking that it would be great to have a resource similar to PHP.net where you could just append the function name to the end of a url, and get some relevant Ruby/Rails examples. Well, [somebody beat me to it][1].<!-- more -->

The folks over at [Rails for PHP Developers][2] have a pretty good start on content, especially for Array, String and Filesystem functions. The feature I was planning on, which I am not seeing their site, is a way for the community to contribute. Even if it were heavily moderated, I think it would be a boon for the site to flesh out its reference much more quickly.

*Update:* The "Rails for PHP Developers" site appears to no longer exist.
