## The modern web's &lt;img&gt; problem
We can all agree that web performance is a serious problem that warrants our time and effort. Recent reports indicate that the average website is now over 2MB, with images accounting for over 70% of that weight. But fear not, there are many approaches to alleviating our image problem. We'll look at several real-world examples of how to deal with image overload, as well as some recent additions to modern browsers that will help us in our fight against one-size-fits-all image bloat.
