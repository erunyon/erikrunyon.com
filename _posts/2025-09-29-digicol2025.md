## Description

### Roll for sanity: Surviving the ever-expanding web feature bestiary

Are you, brave front-end adventurer, feeling your sanity slipping as the Ever-Expanding Web Feature Bestiary grows with each browser update? Have you encountered strange and powerful creatures like "popovers" and "functions" and wondered how to tame them?

Join us on this perilous quest as we delve into the depths of the latest web platform additions. We will examine these fearsome beasts, dissecting their syntax and revealing their practical applications in the realm of higher ed. We'll learn to harness their power for real-world encounters, and even glimpse into the future, where new and even more formidable creatures lurk.

Prepare your character sheets, sharpen your coding blades and roll for sanity as we navigate this challenging and ever-evolving landscape. Will you emerge victorious, a master of the modern web, or will the Bestiary claim your mind?
