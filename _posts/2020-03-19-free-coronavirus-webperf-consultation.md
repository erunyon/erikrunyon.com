I think we can all agree we are living in interesting times. It's going to be some time before the effect the COVID-19 outbreak is having on higher-ed will be fully realized. Many universities, including Notre Dame, have suspended in-person classes for the remainder of the semester. And during this time it's incredibly important that our coronavirus informational sites be as helpful and available as possible.<!-- more -->

I've seen several reports about the strain the U.S. broadband infrastructure will be under in the coming months. This is going to directly impact the ability of our websites to meet our communities needs. And if other universities are seeing the traffic we are, then it can directly effect not only the coronavirus information site, but any other site hosted on the CMS.

To help during this time of increased traffic, I'm offering free web performance consultation for any higher education coronavirus website that is experiencing slow load times. To get started, have someone with direct control or influence over your coronavirus information site [contact me directly](/contact/).

In the meantime, stay safe out there friends. This is going to be a marathon.
