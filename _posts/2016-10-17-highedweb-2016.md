My presentation for [HighEdWeb 2016](http://2016.highedweb.org/) in Memphis was about how to use Service Workers to build offline websites and progressive web apps.

## Description

Lets face it. There are more devices out there than you can support with dedicated native apps. And except for very specific cases, most of what you’ll want to do with your app is available through web API’s. And yes, this includes offline support. Whether it’s a loss of cellular connectivity or lousy wi-fi at a conference, there will be times when a site can and should be available when the network is not. During this presentation we’ll take a look at Service Workers, which can be used to store data in the client browser, and how you can leverage them.
