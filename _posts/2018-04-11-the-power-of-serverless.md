This site has been served statically for some time now. With my recent switch to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting, I find "serverless" services rather fascinating. Chris Coyier recently launched [The Power of Serverless for Front-End Developers](https://thepowerofserverless.info/) which lists a number of services, ideas, and resources for front-end devs looking to get started with serverless technologies.

> Let's get one thing out of the way: it still involves servers, so that word serverless might feel a bit disingenuous. It's actually a new way to pay for and work with servers that, in many cases, is cheaper and easier than buying and managing your own servers.

Expanding the capabilities of statically hosted sites is pretty exciting.
