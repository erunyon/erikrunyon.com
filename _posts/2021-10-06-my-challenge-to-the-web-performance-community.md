[Philip Walton](https://twitter.com/philwalton) on the difficulties the webperf community faces when discussing web performance. Simple numbers don't cut it. We need to provide context when discussing performance results.

> What concerns me about this practice is that it glosses over a lot of important nuance, and it perpetuates the idea that synthetic or lab-based tools (like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and many others) are genuine and precise assessments of a site’s actual, real-world performance—rather than what they are: tools to test, debug, diagnose, optimize, and predict performance or detect regressions under a set of controlled conditions.

I'm definitely guilty of the simplicity he discusses. Thanks for the challenge Philip.
