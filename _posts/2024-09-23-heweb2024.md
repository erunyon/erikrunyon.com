## Description

### CSS is Awesome

Over the past few years, CSS has been gaining features at a rate that is almost impossible to follow. Features that once required pre-processors are now native to the platform. Variables? Check. Nesting? Check. And now there's even whispers of mixins.

During this presentation we will examine many of the latest features added to CSS including layers, container queries, subgrid, nesting, and probably the dozens of others added since this presentation was submitted. We will discuss the syntax and look at real-world use-cases. We will also briefly cover what's on the horizon for CSS.
