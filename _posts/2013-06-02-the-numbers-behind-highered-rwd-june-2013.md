title: "The Numbers Behind HigherEd RWD - June 2013"

Back in January [I posted numbers](/2013/01/the-numbers-behind-highered-rwd/) gathered from the [HigherEd RWD Directory](/highered-rwd-directory/). The size of the list has more than doubled since then. The bad news? Almost every number has increased (that's a bad thing). Additional stats since last report includes image count, size and percentage of page weight.

On a side note. Last June the directory had 16 entries. Over the course of the year we added 100 responsive/adaptive sites.

## HigherEd RWD Sites: 116

### Desktop

I tested with a browser width of ~1200px. Load time is based on a combination of tests from SW Michigan and Northern Indiana. Distance to hosts could definitely be a factor.

* **Load Time:** 3.4 seconds
* **Requests:** 60.3
* **Size:** 1.7 MB
* **Images** 34.7
* **Image Size** 1.3 MB
* **Image % of total page weight** 77%
* **CSS Files:** 6.7
* **CSS Size:** 101.0 KB
* **JS Files:** 11.8
* **JS Size:** 193.1 KB

### Small Screen

These numbers were gathered using a desktop browser at a narrow width (~320px) and an iPhone 5 UA string to attempt a simulation of a mobile device. For this reason, "load time" should be taken with an extremely large grain of salt.

* **Load time:** 3.04 seconds
* **Requests:** 56.3
* **Size:** 1.6 MB
* **Images** 31.4
* **Image Size** 1.2 MB
* **Image % of total page weight** 74%
* **CSS Files:** 6.6
* **CSS Size:** 101.2 kb
* **JS Files:** 11.8
* **JS Size:** 217.7 KB

### Mobile Sites

I found 47 dedicated "mobile" sites from the list of 116 RWD sites in the directory to compare numbers. The focus here was on size, not load time.

* **Load Time:** 1.62 seconds
* **Size:** 180.4 kb
