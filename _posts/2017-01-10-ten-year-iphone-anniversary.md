Apple just celebrated ten years of the iPhone. I didn't get the first iPhone, but by iPhone 3G still works.

A lot has changed between my first iPhone and my current iPhone 6, but what hasn't changed is that it's still an indispensable tool. It has taken on the role of primary communication device, entertainer (what did we do in grocery store lines before we had smart phones), and conduit to the whole of humanity's knowledge.

Thanks Apple.
